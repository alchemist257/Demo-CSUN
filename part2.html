  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">I am sure that I am not the only one that see Los Angeles as beautiful. So every other Saturday (depending on school work) I enojoy going out to exploring Los Angeles. The Trollmotion crew and I enjoy exploring abandoned places or pretty much anywhere that has a great view of Los Angeles</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">There are two memoral spots in downtown that I am fond of. One of them being a place that I am sad is no longer there known as the 6th street bridge.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">I am not sure  of all the specifications but apparently the 6th street bridge was destroyed in ordered to be built again as more earthquake proof.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">But I think I was at home and watching Fear the season 1 premier of FEAR THE WALKING DEAD when I realized there was a place that they had filmed that I have been wanted to explore because I have seen in it in films, music videos, and photographers. So I began researching and found out that there was an entrance right at the bottom of the 6th street bridge.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">So I gather the Trollmotion crew and my camera and headed out! At that time I had a 99 VW jetta very compact and low but it didn't stop us.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">When we finally made it to the location we drove around for hours trying to find the entrance! Eventually we realized that it was in plain sight lol. Mind you we wer doing this mission (as we called it) at 11PM so it was pretty dark since the only way to get under the 6th street bridge by car was to go down this very dark tunnel.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Eventually I got the balls to drive down under the 6th Street bridge. According to other people that were there we were fortunate to have goe that day since it had been raining and their were not alot of water flooding the area</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">After chilling there for a cool minute and taking a bunch of pics we decided to dip since it was starting to get creepy seeing as we were the only people around. Right after we left the cops showed up to close up the entrance! Sheesh! That was close!</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Exercitationem aperiam veniam perspiciatis iure ad nobis necessitatibus cumque cupiditate obcaecati natus. Neque nostrum maxime id veritatis tempore, a voluptate voluptatem et! A ullam id aliquam? Recusandae deleniti odit fugit!</p>

  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The second place in Los Angeles that is my favorite would be a place the Trollmotion crew and I call, The Spot!</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The Spot is located in downtown by the downtown police department. It is just a garage from the outside, BUT if you go in the parking lot and go all the way to the top you will be treated to a dope view of downtown Los Angeles.</p>

<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg">
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">I first discovered this spot back in the day when I used to sell medicinal herb;). It was during this time one of my clients had asked me if I could drop some off. I didnt decline orders since money was money so I drove alll the way to the location and waiting outside, to which the homie was like nah bro come up trust me you'll love it up here.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Intrigued I parked my car and took the elevator up. Sure enough I  loved the view. It was the best to me at the time. I loved it sooo much that for like two years straight I would drive up there every weekend and chill there with the Trollmotion crew and just sip and enjoy the view... ahh good times.</p>
